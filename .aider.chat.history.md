A stylized logo featuring a bold, modern 'A' in the center, surrounded by a subtle gradient background from deep blue to teal, with a small gear icon in the lower right corner to represent technology and innovation. The 'A' is white with a slight shadow, and the gear is silver with a subtle bevel effect. The overall design is clean, minimalistic, and conveys a sense of forward-thinking technology.

📋 PHASE 6: INTEGRATION & TESTING
Command 24: End-to-End Flow Integration
In main App.jsx, connect all components to create complete user flow:

1. User lands on app → sees landing page with "Connect Wallet"
2. Clicks Connect Wallet → connects to Base network
3. Dashboard loads → shows stats, recent activity
4. User clicks "Take Skill Test" → selects category
5. AI generates test questions → user answers
6. Submit test → AI analyzes → shows score
7. If passed → "Mint Skill NFT" button appears
8. User mints NFT → transaction sent to blockchain
9. NFT appears in Reputation Profile
10. User browses Job Bounties → filtered by verified skills
11. Clicks job → sees details → clicks Apply
12. Fills application form → submits on-chain
13. Application appears in tracker
14. When job completed → reputation updates automatically

Test each step:
- Add loading states between steps
- Error handling at each point
- Success confirmations
- State updates properly
- UI reflects blockchain state
Command 25: Error Handling & Edge Cases
Add comprehensive error handling throughout app:

Wallet errors:

- Rate limited: show "please wait" message
- Invalid response: fallback to default questions
- Network error: offline mode message

Form validation:
- Empty required fields: highlight in red
- Invalid wallet address: format check
- Deadline in past: prevent submission
- Bounty too low: warning message

Display user-friendly error messages with:
- Clear explanation
- Suggested fix
- Retry button
- Support contact
Command 26: Performance Optimization
Optimize app performance:

1. Code splitting:
   - Lazy load heavy components (JobDetail, SkillTest)
   - Use React.lazy and Suspense
   - Show loading skeletons

2. Data caching:
   - Cache blockchain queries for 5 minutes
   - Cache AI-generated tests for 1 hour
   - Use localStorage for user preferences

3. Image optimization:
   - Lazy load NFT images
   - Use placeholder while loading
   - Compress uploaded images

4. API call optimization:
   - Debounce search inputs (500ms)
   - Batch multiple contract reads into multicall
   - Cancel pending requests on unmount

5. Re-render optimization:
   - Use React.memo on expensive components
   - useMemo for filtered/sorted lists

     build: {
       target: 'es2020',
       minify: 'terser',
       rollupOptions: {
         output: {

I need the current contents of `mini-app/app/page.tsx` to locate the exact `any` type that’s causing the build error. Once I have that, I can replace it with the correct TypeScript type.
